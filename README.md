# Learning JavaScript Repository

This is a repository for learning JavaScript. The purpose of this repository is to provide a place to store and track my progress as I learn JavaScript.
## Contents

The repository contains the following:

    README.md: This file, which contains information about the repository.
    index.html: A simple HTML file to test the JavaScript code.
    script.js: A JavaScript file where I will be adding my code while learning.

To use this repository, you can simply clone or download the repository to your local machine and open index.html in your web browser. This will load the JavaScript file and you can see the output in the console.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the JavaScript code in script.js to further your learning. You can also add more HTML and CSS files as needed.
